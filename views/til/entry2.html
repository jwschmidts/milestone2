		<h1>xkill</h1>
		<p>Today while working in my virtual machine that is running linux, a program stopped
     responding and I could not kill it. I was forced to find another way to do that. This
    was through xkill. You type that in the command line and it allows you to then click
  on the window that you would like to close and stops it. It seems to be like the task
manager on a windows machine.</p>
