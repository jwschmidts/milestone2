		<h1>Nav Bar</h1>
		<p>I have been very interested in Web Development for a while. While at work I do a little html coding, but most of it is for
		functional value and not for style. I use mostly other peoples css so I do not know it as much. I spent the time to learn how
		to make a nave bar that looks a little better than the basic list.</p>
